      <h1>All About Ducks</h1>
      <h3>Their origin</h3>
  
      <p>Ducks originated in the land of Dooky. They loved Dooky so much until it exploded. Ducks then had to find a new place to live.</p>
      <p>After the ducks move around a few times, they finally settled in a coup, but the coup wasn't safe. Racoons frequented the coup and murdered the ducks on by one.</p>
      <p>After all but one of the ducks had been murdered, a human came along and figured out how the racoon was getting into the coup. The human waited in the dark for the racoon to return for its last meal...hahaha...little did it know it would be its last meal.  The human watched and waited and shot the racoon in the face; killing it immediately. The lone surviving duck was happy.</p>
